Source code -> Byte code (by jdk compiler)   

.java  -> .class

Byte code -> Native code (by jvm)

## Function vs. Class  
- Function is a block of code which takes some input, performs some operations
and returns some output.  
The functions stored inside classes are called methods.
The function we have used is called main.  

- Class is a group of objects which have common properties. A class can have
some properties and functions (called methods).  
The class we have used is Main.
